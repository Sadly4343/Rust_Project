# Overview

The goal I decided for this project is that I wanted to learn more about the way rust is designed and implement my knowledge of C# and Python in order to attempt to create projects with the Rust Software Language.
I wanted to find a language that was extremely fast and offered the ability to deal with garbage collecting within the language itself and found that Rust offers many tools to allow for proper coding and implementation of 
the structure within the code. 

The software that I wrote to demonstrate the implementation of Rust language was creating a calculator that could do the various calculations that would be required in a simple calculator as well as factorial calculations that would be difficult to calculate by hand. The other project that I decided to work on was a Password Manager that would make use of hashing to properly store the passwords for the user.


The purpose of this software was to learn how to create projects that can test and implement various Rust architecture so I chose to use Struct and Impl within my code as well as using the Cargo that is built into rust with the ability to choose dependencies for the projects and offer a robust error handling system. After studying rust and learning how many errors like syntax errors are incredibly common in the industry and one of the largest coding issues present and that it works well to directly require the programmer to identify and create and handle these errors otherwise the program will not run. I found this fascinating and wanted to attempt to work on projects that could make use of that error handling and understand the language better. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
